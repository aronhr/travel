Here are some beer drinking games that can be easily hosted on a tablet or phone, ensuring everyone can participate using one shared device:

### x1. **Kings Cup (Digital Edition)**
- **How it Works**: Create a digital version of the classic card-based drinking game, Kings Cup, with a virtual deck of cards displayed on the tablet.
- **Game Rules**:
    - Each player takes turns drawing a card.
    - The card’s value corresponds to a specific rule (e.g., 2 = "You", 3 = "Me", 4 = "Floor", etc.).
    - You can display the rules of each card on the tablet for reference.
    - Players follow the instructions for each card (e.g., take a sip, make a rule, pass a drink).

### x2. **Spin the Bottle (Tablet Version)**
- **How it Works**: Use the tablet to simulate a digital version of the classic "Spin the Bottle."
- **Game Rules**:
    - Place the tablet in the middle of the group.
    - Players take turns tapping a virtual bottle on the screen to spin it.
    - When the bottle stops, the player it points to must drink or complete a fun challenge shown on the screen (e.g., truth or dare, drink twice, make a rule).

### x3. **Drink Roulette**
- **How it Works**: Set up a simple roulette game where each "spin" leads to a fun drinking challenge or mini-game.
- **Game Rules**:
    - Players tap to "spin" the roulette wheel.
    - The wheel lands on random drinking tasks such as "Everyone drinks", "Take two sips", "Pass your drink", or "Swap drinks."
    - You can add custom challenges to make it more engaging.

### x4. **Quiz Game (Drink for Wrong Answers)**
- **How it Works**: Create a quick trivia quiz app or use a quiz app from an app store.
- **Game Rules**:
    - Players take turns answering questions from various categories.
    - For each incorrect answer, the player must take a drink.
    - You can customize the questions to be about anything—music, pop culture, or even personal trivia about the group.

### nooooo5. **Beer Pong Challenge**
- **How it Works**: Use a digital version of Beer Pong where players flick ping-pong balls into virtual cups on the tablet.
- **Game Rules**:
    - Players take turns "flicking" the ball toward cups displayed on the screen.
    - If the ball lands in a cup, the opponent drinks.
    - You can keep track of scores and declare the first player to clear all cups the winner.

### 6. **Never Have I Ever (Digital)**
- **How it Works**: Use a tablet to display random "Never Have I Ever" prompts.
- **Game Rules**:
    - The tablet generates prompts like “Never have I ever… gone skydiving.”
    - Players who have done the activity must take a drink.
    - You can either input your own questions or let the app randomly generate them.

### 7. **Flip Cup Countdown**
- **How it Works**: A digital countdown on the tablet helps players time their flips in a variation of the classic Flip Cup game.
- **Game Rules**:
    - Each player flips a virtual cup on the tablet by swiping up at the right time.
    - A timer counts how fast each player flips their cup.
    - The slowest player drinks.

### 8. **Category Game**
- **How it Works**: Display a category on the tablet, and players take turns saying something that fits that category.
- **Game Rules**:
    - Example categories could be "Types of Beer" or "Movie Titles".
    - Players take turns naming something in the category.
    - The first person to hesitate or repeat a word has to drink.

### 9. **Dice Drinking Game (Tablet Version)**
- **How it Works**: Roll a digital die on the tablet, and the number corresponds to specific drinking actions.
- **Game Rules**:
    - Players take turns tapping the screen to roll the virtual dice.
    - Each number (1-6) is tied to a drinking challenge (e.g., "1 = You drink", "2 = Everyone drinks", "3 = Swap drinks").
    - The randomness keeps the game exciting and unpredictable.

### 10. **Pass the Bomb (Drinking Version)**
- **How it Works**: Use the tablet to simulate a ticking bomb that passes between players.
- **Game Rules**:
    - The "bomb" (timer) starts when the first player taps the tablet.
    - Each player passes the tablet after saying a word in a given category.
    - If the timer "explodes" while someone is holding the tablet, that person drinks.
